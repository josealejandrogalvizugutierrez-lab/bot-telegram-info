\# Refund Policy



\*\*Effective Date:\*\* October 8, 2025



All payments are processed through \*\*Paddle.com Market Ltd\*\* (our Merchant of Record). This policy exclusively covers refunds related to technical failures in the delivery of the Service.



\### 1. Non-Refundable Services (Final Sales)

Given that our services are digital and involve the immediate consumption of third-party resources (AI APIs), most purchases are \*\*final and non-refundable\*\*. This includes:

\* Services successfully used and delivered (e.g., a generated image, story, or audio file).

\* Cases where the AI output did not meet the user's creative expectations (e.g., "the image did not turn out as I hoped").



\### 2. Refunds for Technical Failure

We will issue a full refund only if the following conditions are met:

\* The user has been charged for a service, AND

\* The bot or the AI API failed technically and was \*\*unable to deliver\*\* the expected result (e.g., an error message with no attached file).



\### 3. Requesting a Refund

All refund requests must be sent to \*\*Paddle\*\* or to the privacy contact email address (\*\*alejandrogalvizu@gmail.com\*\*) within seven (7) days of the transaction.
